# Changelog

Notable changes of the profile and the `ga4gh-io-schema` package. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- The command-line tools are subcommands of one command, `ga4gh-io-schema`:
  `ga4gh-io-schema validate` replaces `ga4gh-io-schema-validator`, which is
  removed without an alias. The exit status now tells failures apart (1: the
  schema doesn't comply, 2: wrong arguments, 3: a file can't be read, isn't
  valid JSON, or the meta-schema is malformed or has references that can't
  be resolved, 4: unexpected errors); before,
  all failures exited with 1. (#9)
- `x-ga4gh-drs-uri` is removed; `"schemes": ["drs"]` of the new
  `x-ga4gh-file` annotation replaces it. (#10)
- Files and directories are file references (`x-ga4gh-file`), no longer
  strings with `"format": "uri"` and `contentMediaType`. A file reference is
  a flat string schema: no `format` (`uri` rejects compact DRS identifiers),
  no `contentMediaType`, `contentEncoding` or `contentSchema` (they describe
  the string, not the referenced file; the media type goes into `mediaType`),
  and no in-place applicators such as `allOf` (the meta-schema checks the
  annotated schema; schemas around it must not add these keywords either).
  (#10)
- The format of a file is named by `ontology` of the file reference;
  `x-ga4gh-ontology` names the data of a parameter (e.g., an EDAM data
  term), no longer also the format. (#10)
- The `$id` of an IO schema, if present, must be an absolute URI and not the
  URL of a branch at GitHub or GitLab. (#12)
- The profile is cut back to its core use (forms, run requests, outputs),
  and the meta-schema rejects what was removed. The
  [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#scope-of-version-03) gives the reasons and lists
  what is deferred. (#17)
  - `x-ga4gh-fa-icon` is removed (cut); schemas that use it no longer
    validate.
  - The `rst` value of `x-ga4gh-description-format` is removed (cut); use
    `markdown` or `plain_text`.
  - The `password` widget is removed (cut): workflow parameters are not a
    channel for secrets.
  - The viewers `genome-browser`, `scatter-plot`, `pdf-viewer` and
    `markdown-viewer` are removed from the vocabulary of UI widgets
    (deferred); `table-viewer`, `html-viewer` and download remain.
  - `x-ga4gh-tabular-schema` is experimental and only a hint for clients;
    validation of tabular files is deferred.
  - Servers no longer accept IO schemas supplied by clients in a run request
    (cut); they use schemas from trusted sources only.
  - The proposed TRS file type `IO_SCHEMA` is deferred; IO schemas are
    published as TRS files of type `OTHER`.
  - The proposal no longer covers chaining workflows by ontology terms
    (deferred), drafting of IO schemas by AI agents (cut), or the claim that
    the profile suits machine learning pipelines (cut; an open question on
    the roadmap).

### Added

- File references (`x-ga4gh-file`): kind (`file` or `directory`), media
  type, format term, compression, required secondary files as CWL-style
  suffix patterns, and allowed URI schemes; a defined value syntax (absolute
  URIs, including compact DRS identifiers, and paths for inputs only); a
  specification page with the mapping to CWL, WDL and nf-schema. The
  examples use them, and their inputs reject unknown and missing values
  (`required`, `additionalProperties: false`). (#10)
- Identity and engine binding: the top-level keyword `x-ga4gh-workflow` ties
  an IO schema to a TRS tool version and its engine (TRS ids, descriptor
  type and version, path and checksum of the primary descriptor, entry
  point; the entry point is required for WDL), and `x-ga4gh-parameter` binds
  a parameter to the engine's parameter name and type. New vocabulary files
  `workflow.schema.json` and `parameter.schema.json`; new page "Identity and
  engine binding" with the rules for `$id`s and for drift. (#12)
- A convention for publishing IO schemas in TRS without a change of TRS:
  file type `OTHER`, path `ga4gh-io.schema.json` next to the primary
  descriptor, identified by `$schema`; an `IO_SCHEMA` file type is deferred.
  (#12)
- Shared conventions of all subcommands: input from a path or `-` (standard
  input), `--output` for the result, `--json` for results and errors as JSON
  objects. (#9)
- A CLI reference in the documentation, generated from the parser. (#9)
